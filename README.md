# Enhanced Breathing Detection Using Beamforming and Multi-Microphone Arrays

This repository contains the full codebase for a Final Year Project (FYP) focused on non-invasive breathing sound detection using a custom-designed 3D MEMS microphone array. The project combines embedded hardware recording with advanced MATLAB signal processing techniques, including beamforming and multi-algorithmic breathing detection.
